  journal = {Journal of Physiology},
  year = {1997},
  volume = {501},
  pages = {225-241},

  abstract = {1. Recordings were made of local field potential (slow waves) and
	pyramidal tract neurone (PTN) discharge from pairs of sites separated
	by a horizontal distance of up to 1.5 mm in the primary motor cortex
	of two conscious macaque monkeys performing a precision grip task.
	2. In both monkeys, the slow wave recordings showed bursts of oscillations
	in the 20-30 Hz range. Spectral analysis revealed that the oscillations
	were coherent between the two simultaneously recorded cortical sites.
	In the monkey from which most data were recorded, the mean frequency
	of peak coherence was 23.4 Hz. 3. Coherence in this frequency range
	was also seen between cortical slow wave recordings and rectified
	EMG of hand and forearm muscles active during the task, and between
	pairs of rectified EMGs. 4. The dynamics of the coherence were investigated
	by analysing short, quasi-stationary data segments aligned relative
	to task performance. This revealed that the 20-30 Hz coherent oscillations
	were present mainly during the hold phase of the precision grip task.
	5. The spikes of identified PTNs were used to compile spike-triggered
	averages of the slow wave recordings. Oscillations were seen in 11/17
	averages of the slow wave recorded on the same electrode as the triggering
	spike, and 11/17 averages of the slow wave recorded on the distant
	electrode. The mean period of these oscillations was 45.8 ms. 6.
	It is concluded that oscillations in the range 20-30 Hz are present
	in monkey motor cortex, are coherent between spatially separated
	cortical sites, and encompass the pyramidal tract output neurones.
	They are discernable in the EMG of active muscles, and show a consistent
	task-dependent modulation.},

  abstract = {The ability of oscillating networks to synchronize despite significant
	separation in space, and thus time, is of biological significance,
	given that human gamma activity can synchronize over distances of
	several millimeters to centimeters during perceptual and learning
	tasks. We use computer simulations of networks consisting of excitatory
	pyramidal cells (e-cells) and inhibitory interneurons (i-cells),
	modeling two tonically driven assemblies separated by large (>or=8
	ms) conduction delays. The results are as follows. 1) Two assemblies
	separated by large conduction delays can fire synchronously at beta
	frequency (with i-cells firing at gamma frequency) under two timing
	conditions: e-cells of (say) assembly 2 are still inhibited "delay
	+ spike generation milliseconds" after the e-cell beat of assembly
	1; this means that the e-cell inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP)
	cannot be significantly shorter than the delay (2-site effect). This
	implies for a given decay time constant that the interneuron -->
	pyramidal cell conductances must be large enough. The e-cell IPSP
	must last longer than the i-cell IPSP, i.e., the interneuron -->
	pyramidal cell conductance must be sufficiently large and the interneuron
	--> interneuron conductance sufficiently small (local effect). 2)
	We define a "long-interval doublet" as a pair of interneuron action
	potentials-separated by approximately "delay milliseconds"-in which
	a) the first spike is induced by tonic inputs and/or excitation from
	nearby e-cells, while b) the second spike is induced by (delayed)
	excitation from distant e-cells. "Long-interval population doublets"
	(long-interval doublets of the i-cell population) are necessary for
	synchronized firing in our networks. Failure to produce them leads
	to almost anti-phase activity at gamma frequency. 3) An (almost)
	anti-phase oscillation is the most stable oscillation pattern of
	two assemblies that are separated by axonal conduction delays of
	approximately one-half a gamma period (delays from 8 to 17 ms in
	our simulations) and that are firing at gamma frequency. 4) Two assemblies
	separated by large conduction delays can synchronize their activity
	with the help of interneuron plasticity. They can also synchronize
	without pyramidal cell --> pyramidal cell connections being present.
	The presence of pyramidal cell --> pyramidal cell connections allows,
	however, for synchronization if other parameters are at inappropriate
	values for synchronization to occur. 5) Synchronization of two assemblies
	separated by large conduction delays with the help of interneuron
	plasticity is not simply due to slowing down of the oscillation frequency.
	It is reached with the help of a "synchronizing-weak-beat," which
	induces sudden changes in the oscillation period length of the two
	assemblies.},

  abstract = {Adolescence refers to the period of physical and psychological development

	loosely anchored to the onset of puberty, which brings dramatic alterations

	onset is also associated with profound changes in drives, motivations,
	psychology, and social life; these changes continue throughout adolescence.
	There is an increasing number of neuroimaging studies looking at
	the development of the brain, both structurally and functionally,
	during adolescence. Almost all of these studies have defined development
	by chronological age, which shows a strong-but not unitary-correlation
	with pubertal stage. Very few neuroimaging studies have associated
	brain development with pubertal stage, and yet there is tentative
	evidence to suggest that puberty might play an important role in
	some aspects of brain and cognitive development. In this paper we
	describe this research, and we suggest that, in the future, developmental
	neuroimaging studies of adolescence should consider the role of puberty.},

  abstract = {The kinetics of synaptogenesis in the primary visual cortex (Brodmann's
	area 17) were analyzed by electron microscopy in 33 rhesus monkeys,
	ranging in age from the 50th embryonic day (E50) to 20 years. A series
	of overlapping electron micrographs (vertical probes) were examined
	at each age on sections of the upper bank of the calcarine fissure.
	Synaptic contacts were first observed in the E50 specimen in the
	subplate and marginal zone (prospective layer I). In the cortical
	plate itself, synapses appear between E65 and E89 starting in the
	prospective layer VI. By E112, after all cortical neurons have assumed
	their laminar positions, synapses situated predominantly on dendritic
	shafts were present at a low density throughout the full thickness
	of the cortical plate. Thereafter, synapses accumulate more rapidly
	on dendritic spines and by E144 an equal number of contacts are found
	on both spines and shafts. The density of synapses continues to increase
	exponentially in all layers and reaches the mean maximum density
	of about 90 synapses per 100 microns 3 of neuropil by the third postnatal
	month. During the next 2 postnatal years the density of synaptic
	contacts decreases only slightly to a mean of 80/100 microns 3 of
	neuropil. Around the time of puberty, however, synaptic density decreases
	more rapidly to reach the adult level of about 40-50/100 microns
	3 of neuropil. The 40\% decrease in the density of synaptic contacts
	occurring between 2.7 and 5 years represents a loss of about 5000
	synapses per second in the primary visual cortex of the two hemispheres,
	due primarily to the loss of asymmetric synapses situated on dendritic
	spines. The transient phase of high density of synaptic contacts
	located on dendrospines is shorter in thalamo-recipient layer IV
	than in either supra- or intragranular layers and is completed within
	the first postnatal year. It ends earlier in sublayer IVC than in
	layers IVAB and II-III, for example, reflecting biochemical and functional
	maturation of the different visual subsystems.},

  abstract = {EEG and single-unit techniques have been used to study the EEG correlates
	of cellular firing in the neocortex, n. reticularis (RT) and "specific"
	thalamic nuclei, and the cholinergic forebrain area (nucleus basalis,
	NB). Neuronal firing was related to the ongoing behavior of the rat.
	In addition, using a 16-channel neocortical recording/mapping system,
	we studied the effects of ibotenic acid lesion of NB, RT, and other
	thalamic nuclei on the patterns and spatial distribution of neocortical
	electrical activity. The majority of neurons in neocortex, NB, and
	RT increased their firing rates during walking, as compared to during
	immobility, with concurrent decrease of delta power in the neocortical
	EEG. During immobility, high-voltage spindles (HVS; greater than
	1 mV) were occasionally recorded from the neocortex. Depth profiles
	of HVS and slow delta waves were different in the neocortex. Neocortical
	cells decreased their discharge frequency during the positive portion
	of delta waves recorded in layers V and VI. All cells in the neocortex
	and specific thalamic nuclei fired rhythmically and phase-locked
	to the spike component of HVS. RT neurons showed an opposite phase
	relationship and fired mainly during the wave component of HVS. Half
	of the NB neurons also showed phasic modulation with HVS. Circumscribed
	lesion of RT and extensive damage of other thalamic regions, including
	the intralaminar nuclei, suppressed HVS but had no effect on the
	neocortical EEG correlates of behavior. In sharp contrast, damage
	to the NB resulted in a dramatic increase of slow delta waves on
	the side of the lesion, mimicking the effect of scopolamine administration.
	We suggest that the NB plays a key role in neocortical arousal by
	directly activating the neocortex and by suppressing the rhythm generation
	in the RT-thalamocortical circuitry. We further suggest that the
	NB system may serve as a structural basis for the concept of the
	generalized ascending activation of Moruzzi and Magoun (1949).},

	growth, the onset of sexual maturation, the activation of new drives

	and challenges. This review focuses on behavioral changes in this
	interval and is organized by the claim that a key set of these adolescent
	changes are part of a more general re-orientation of social behavior.
	More specifically we hypothesize that pubertal maturation is associated
	with the activation of social and motivational tendencies, which
	in turn influence behavior and emotion in adolescence depending upon
	interactions with social context. We focus on evidence for two examples
	of these motivational changes: (1) increases in sensation-seeking
	(motivational tendency to want to experience high-intensity, exciting
	experiences) and (2) stronger natural interest in--and pursuit of--contact
	with peers and potential romantic partners. We consider how these
	motivational changes contribute to the broader social re-orientation
	of adolescence, including exploration of social experiences, development
	of skills and knowledge relevant to taking on adult social roles,
	individuation from family, and establishment of an individual identity,
	all of which represent core developmental tasks during this period
	in the life span (Blakemore, 2008; Dahl & Spear, 2004; Steinberg
	& Morris, 2000). The paper also emphasizes the importance of investigating
	and understanding the direct influences of puberty on behavior and
	disentangling these from the broader set of changes during adolescent
	development.},

  abstract = {Neuronal gamma-band synchronization is found in many cortical areas,

	synchronization phenomena subserve many different functions. I argue
	that gamma-band synchronization is a fundamental process that subserves
	an elemental operation of cortical computation. Cortical computation
	unfolds in the interplay between neuronal dynamics and structural
	neuronal connectivity. A core motif of neuronal connectivity is convergence,
	which brings about both selectivity and invariance of neuronal responses.
	However, those core functions can be achieved simultaneously only
	if converging neuronal inputs are functionally segmented and if only
	one segment is selected at a time. This segmentation and selection
	can be elegantly achieved if structural connectivity interacts with
	neuronal synchronization. I propose that this process is at least
	one of the fundamental functions of gamma-band synchronization, which

	development in schizophrenia, bipolar illness, and even in siblings
	at genetic risk for these disorders. We describe how these methods
	have helped clarify how cortical development relates to cognitive
	performance, functional recovery or decline in illness, and ongoing
	myelination processes. These time-lapse maps have also been used
	to study effects of genotype and medication on cortical maturation,

	disorders.Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging is
	a relatively novel technique that has several potential advantages
	over task-activation functional magnetic resonance imaging in terms
	of its clinical applicability. A number of research groups have begun
	to investigate the use of resting-state functional magnetic resonance
	imaging in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including Alzheimer's
	disease, depression, and schizophrenia. Although preliminary results
	have been fairly consistent in some disorders (for example, Alzheimer's
	disease) they have been less reproducible in others (schizophrenia).
	Resting-state connectivity has been shown to correlate with behavioral
	performance and emotional measures. It's potential as a biomarker
	of disease and an early objective marker of treatment response is
	genuine but still to be realized.Resting-state functional magnetic
	resonance imaging has made some strides in the clinical realm but
	significant advances are required before it can be used in a meaningful
	way at the single-patient level.},

  abstract = {Neuronal gamma-band (30-100 Hz) synchronization subserves fundamental
	functions in neuronal processing. However, different experimental
	approaches differ widely in their success in finding gamma-band activity.
	We aimed at linking animal and human studies of gamma-band activity
	and at preparing optimized methods for an in-depth investigation
	of the mechanisms and functions of gamma-band activity and gamma-band
	coherence in humans. In the first step described here, we maximized
	the signal-to-noise ratio with which we can observe visually induced
	gamma-band activity in human magnetoencephalographic recordings.
	We used a stimulus and task design that evoked strong gamma-band
	activity in animals and combined it with multi-taper methods for
	spectral analysis and adaptive spatial filtering for source analysis.
	With this approach, we found human visual gamma-band activity very
	reliably across subjects and across multiple recording sessions of
	a given subject. While increases in gamma-band activity are typically
	accompanied by decreases in alpha- and beta-band activity, the gamma-band
	enhancement was often the spectral component with the highest signal-to-noise
	ratio. Furthermore, some subjects demonstrated two clearly separate
	visually induced gamma bands, one around 40 Hz and another between
	70 and 80 Hz. Gamma-band activity was sustained for the entire stimulation
	period, which was up to 3 s. The sources of gamma-band activity were
	in the calcarine sulcus in all subjects. The results localize human
	visual gamma-band activity in frequency, time and space and the described
	methods allow its further investigation with great sensitivity.},

  abstract = {Brain cholinergic neurons are critical for memory function and their

	One role of cholinergic neurons is to elicit an oscillatory activity
	called theta rhythm in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in
	memory processing. Theta rhythm occurs during periods of learning,
	but its effect on the synaptic plasticity that underlies learning
	remains unclear. We have studied synaptic plasticity in hippocampal
	slices during theta-frequency oscillations induced by a cholinergic
	agonist. Here we report that during these oscillations, synapses
	are in a state of heightened plasticity and can be modified by what
	would otherwise be ineffective stimulation. This heightened plasticity
	is sensitive to the timing of incoming stimuli with respect to the
	oscillatory activity. The results suggest that cholinergic systems
	may affect memory formation through the induction of an oscillatory
	state in which the requirements for synaptic plasticity are dramatically
	altered.},

  abstract = {Evidence is presented that EEG oscillations in the alpha and theta
	band reflect cognitive and memory performance in particular. Good
	performance is related to two types of EEG phenomena (i) a tonic
	increase in alpha but a decrease in theta power, and (ii) a large
	phasic (event-related) decrease in alpha but increase in theta, depending
	on the type of memory demands. Because alpha frequency shows large
	interindividual differences which are related to age and memory performance,
	this double dissociation between alpha vs. theta and tonic vs. phasic
	changes can be observed only if fixed frequency bands are abandoned.
	It is suggested to adjust the frequency windows of alpha and theta
	for each subject by using individual alpha frequency as an anchor
	point. Based on this procedure, a consistent interpretation of a
	variety of findings is made possible. As an example, in a similar
	way as brain volume does, upper alpha power increases (but theta
	power decreases) from early childhood to adulthood, whereas the opposite
	holds true for the late part of the lifespan. Alpha power is lowered
	and theta power enhanced in subjects with a variety of different
	neurological disorders. Furthermore, after sustained wakefulness
	and during the transition from waking to sleeping when the ability
	to respond to external stimuli ceases, upper alpha power decreases,
	whereas theta increases. Event-related changes indicate that the
	extent of upper alpha desynchronization is positively correlated
	with (semantic) long-term memory performance, whereas theta synchronization
	is positively correlated with the ability to encode new information.
	The reviewed findings are interpreted on the basis of brain oscillations.
	It is suggested that the encoding of new information is reflected
	by theta oscillations in hippocampo-cortical feedback loops, whereas
	search and retrieval processes in (semantic) long-term memory are
	reflected by upper alpha oscillations in thalamo-cortical feedback

  abstract = {Evidence is presented that EEG oscillations in the alpha and theta
	band reflect cognitive and memory performance in particular. Good
	performance is related to two types of EEG phenomena (i) a tonic
	increase in alpha but a decrease in theta power, and (ii) a large
	phasic (event-related) decrease in alpha but increase in theta, depending
	on the type of memory demands. Because alpha frequency shows large
	interindividual differences which are related to age and memory performance,
	this double dissociation between alpha vs. theta and tonic vs. phasic
	changes can be observed only if fixed frequency bands are abandoned.
	It is suggested to adjust the frequency windows of alpha and theta
	for each subject by using individual alpha frequency as an anchor
	point. Based on this procedure, a consistent interpretation of a
	variety of findings is made possible. As an example, in a similar
	way as brain volume does, upper alpha power increases (but theta
	power decreases) from early childhood to adulthood, whereas the opposite
	holds true for the late part of the lifespan. Alpha power is lowered
	and theta power enhanced in subjects with a variety of different
	neurological disorders. Furthermore, after sustained wakefulness
	and during the transition from waking to sleeping when the ability
	to respond to external stimuli ceases, upper alpha power decreases,
	whereas theta increases. Event-related changes indicate that the
	extent of upper alpha desynchronization is positively correlated
	with (semantic) long-term memory performance, whereas theta synchronization
	is positively correlated with the ability to encode new information.
	The reviewed findings are interpreted on the basis of brain oscillations.
	It is suggested that the encoding of new information is reflected
	by theta oscillations in hippocampo-cortical feedback loops, whereas
	search and retrieval processes in (semantic) long-term memory are
	reflected by upper alpha oscillations in thalamo-cortical feedback
	loops.},

  abstract = {The traditional belief is that the event-related alpha response can
	solely be described in terms of suppression or event-related desynchronization
	(ERD). Recent research, however, has shown that under certain conditions
	alpha responds reliably with an increase in amplitudes (event-related
	synchronization or ERS). ERS is elicited in situations, where subjects
	withhold or control the execution of a response and is obtained over
	sites that probably are under, or exert top-down control. Thus, we
	assume that alpha ERS reflects top-down, inhibitory control processes.
	This assumption leads over to the timing aspect of our hypothesis.
	By the very nature of an oscillation, rhythmic amplitude changes
	reflect rhythmic changes in excitation of a population of neurons.
	Thus, the time and direction of a change - described by phase - is
	functionally related to the timing of neuronal activation processes.
	A variety of findings supports this view and shows, e.g., that alpha
	phase coherence increases between task-relevant sites and that phase
	lag lies within a time range that is consistent with neuronal transmission
	speed. Another implication is that phase reset will be a powerful
	mechanism for the event-related timing of cortical processes. Empirical
	evidence suggests that the extent of phase locking is a functionally
	sensitive measure that is related to cognitive performance. Our general
	conclusion is that alpha ERS plays an active role for the inhibitory
	control and timing of cortical processing whereas ERD reflects the
	gradual release of inhibition associated with the emergence of complex
	spreading activation processes.},

	neighbor distances. This means that they are data efficient (with
	k=1 we resolve structures down to the smallest possible scales),
	adaptive (the resolution is higher where data are more numerous),
	and have minimal bias. Indeed, the bias of the underlying entropy
	estimates is mainly due to nonuniformity of the density at the smallest
	resolved scale, giving typically systematic errors which scale as
	functions of k/N for N points. Numerically, we find that both families
	become exact for independent distributions, i.e. the estimator M(X,Y)
	vanishes (up to statistical fluctuations) if mu(x,y)=mu(x)mu(y).
	This holds for all tested marginal distributions and for all dimensions
	of x and y. In addition, we give estimators for redundancies between
	more than two random variables. We compare our algorithms in detail

	of our estimators for assessing the actual independence of components

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Transfer entropy (TE) is a measure for the detection
	of directed interactions. Transfer entropy is an information theoretic
	implementation of Wiener's principle of observational causality.
	It offers an approach to the detection of neuronal interactions that
	is free of an explicit model of the interactions. Hence, it offers
	the power to analyze linear and nonlinear interactions alike. This
	allows for example the comprehensive analysis of directed interactions
	in neural networks at various levels of description. Here, we present
	the open-source MATLAB toolbox TRENTOOL that allows the user to handle
	the considerable complexity of this measure and to validate the obtained
	results using non-parametrical statistical testing. We demonstrate
	the use of the toolbox and the performance of the algorithm on simulated
	data with nonlinear (quadratic) coupling and on local field potentials
	(LFP) recorded from the retina and the optic tectum of the turtle
	(Pseudemys scripta elegans) where a neuronal one-way connection is
	likely present. RESULTS: In simulated data, TE detected information
	flow in the simulated direction reliably with false positives not
	exceeding the rates expected under the null hypothesis. In the LFP
	data, we found directed interactions from the retina to the tectum,
	despite the complicated signal transformations between these stages.
	No false positive interactions in the reverse directions were detected.
	CONCLUSIONS: TRENTOOL is an implementation of transfer entropy and
	mutual information analysis that aims to support the user in the
	application of this information theoretic measure. TRENTOOL is implemented
	as a MATLAB toolbox and available under an open source license (GPL
	v3). For the use with neural data TRENTOOL seamlessly integrates
	with the popular FieldTrip toolbox.},

  abstract = {The human brain undertakes highly sophisticated information processing
	facilitated by the interaction between its sub-regions. We present
	a novel method for interregional connectivity analysis, using multivariate
	extensions to the mutual information and transfer entropy. The method
	allows us to identify the underlying directed information structure
	between brain regions, and how that structure changes according to
	behavioral conditions. This method is distinguished in using asymmetric,
	multivariate, information-theoretical analysis, which captures not
	only directional and non-linear relationships, but also collective
	interactions. Importantly, the method is able to estimate multivariate
	information measures with only relatively little data. We demonstrate
	the method to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging time
	series to establish the directed information structure between brain
	regions involved in a visuo-motor tracking task. Importantly, this
	results in a tiered structure, with known movement planning regions
	driving visual and motor control regions. Also, we examine the changes
	in this structure as the difficulty of the tracking task is increased.
	We find that task difficulty modulates the coupling strength between
	regions of a cortical network involved in movement planning and between
	motor cortex and the cerebellum which is involved in the fine-tuning
	of motor control. It is likely these methods will find utility in
	identifying interregional structure (and experimentally induced changes
	in this structure) in other cognitive tasks and data modalities.},

  abstract = {The emerging organization of anatomical and functional connections
	during human brain development is thought to facilitate global integration
	of information. Recent empirical and computational studies have shown
	that this enhanced capacity for information processing enables a
	diversified dynamic repertoire that manifests in neural activity
	as irregularity and noise. However, transient functional networks
	unfold over multiple time, scales and the embedding of a particular
	region depends not only on development, but also on the manner in
	which sensory and cognitive systems are engaged. Here we show that
	noise is a facet of neural activity that is also sensitive to the
	task context and is highly region specific. Children (6-16 yr) and
	adults (20-41 yr) performed a one-back face recognition task with
	inverted and upright faces. Neuromagnetic activity was estimated
	at several hundred sources in the brain by applying a beamforming
	technique to the magnetoencephalogram (MEG). During development,
	neural activity became more variable across the whole brain, with
	most robust increases in medial parietal regions, such as the precuneus
	and posterior cingulate cortex. For young children and adults, activity
	evoked by upright faces was more variable and noisy compared with
	inverted faces, and this effect was reliable only in the right fusiform
	gyrus. These results are consistent with the notion that upright
	faces engender a variety of integrative neural computations, such
	as the relations among facial features and their holistic constitution.
	This study shows that transient changes in functional integration
	modulated by task demand are evident in the variability of regional
	neural activity.},

	which CA3 output can coordinate CA1 activity to support retrieval

	because, despite the high behavioral threshold to arousing perturbations,
	gross physiological patterns in the forebrain resemble those of waking
	states. To understand how intrahippocampal networks interact during
	REM sleep, we used 96 site silicon probes to record from different
	hippocampal subregions and compared the patterns of activity during
	waking exploration and REM sleep. Dentate/CA3 theta and gamma synchrony
	was significantly higher during REM sleep compared with active waking.
	In contrast, gamma power in CA1 and CA3-CA1 gamma coherence showed
	significant decreases in REM sleep. Changes in unit firing rhythmicity
	and unit-field coherence specified the local generation of these
	patterns. Although these patterns of hippocampal network coordination
	characterized the more common tonic periods of REM sleep (approximately
	95\% of total REM), we also detected large phasic bursts of local
	field potential power in the dentate molecular layer that were accompanied
	by transient increases in the firing of dentate and CA1 neurons.
	In contrast to tonic REM periods, phasic REM epochs were characterized
	by higher theta and gamma synchrony among the dentate, CA3, and CA1
	regions. These data suggest enhanced dentate processing, but limited
	CA3-CA1 coordination during tonic REM sleep. In contrast, phasic
	bursts of activity during REM sleep may provide windows of opportunity
	to synchronize the hippocampal trisynaptic loop and increase output
	to cortical targets. We hypothesize that tonic REM sleep may support
	off-line mnemonic processing, whereas phasic bursts of activity during
	REM may promote memory consolidation.},

  abstract = {Neuroactive steroids are natural or synthetic steroids that rapidly
	alter the excitability of neurons by binding to membrane-bound receptors
	such as those for inhibitory and (or) excitatory neurotransmitters.
	The best-studied neuroactive steroids are a series of sedative-hypnotic
	3 alpha-hydroxy ring A-reduced pregnane steroids that include the
	major metabolites of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone, 3 alpha-hydroxy-5
	alpha-pregnan-20-one (allopregnanolone) and 3 alpha,21-dihydroxy-5
	alpha-pregnan-20-one (allotetrahydroDOC), respectively. These 3 alpha-hydroxysteroids
	do not interact with classical intracellular steroid receptors but
	bind stereoselectively and with high affinity to receptors for the
	major inhibitory neurotransmitter in brain, gamma-amino-butyric acid
	(GABA). Biochemical and electrophysiological studies have shown that
	these steroids markedly augment GABA-activated chloride ion currents
	in a manner similar (but not identical) to that of anesthetic barbiturates.
	Several steroids have also been observed to have convulsant or proconvulsant
	properties, including the synthetic amidine 3 alpha-hydroxy-16-imino-5
	beta-17-azaandrostan-11-one (RU5135) and the natural sulfate esters
	of pregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone. Several of these have
	been shown to be bicuculline or picrotoxin-like GABAA receptor antagonists.
	Examples of steroids that alter neuronal excitability rapidly by
	augmenting or inhibiting excitatory amino acid receptor-mediated
	responses have also been reported. Recently, allopregnanolone and
	allotetrahydroDOC have also been measured in brain and plasma where
	their levels have been shown to fluctuate in response to stress and
	during the estrous and menstrual cycles of rats and humans, respectively.
	Although the major fraction of allopregnanolone in tissue, including
	brain, is of adrenal and/or ovarian origin, appreciable levels of
	allopregnanolone can still be measured in the brains of adrenalectomized
	and/or oophorectomized animals. Receptor-active neurosteroids may
	represent an important class of neuromodulators that can rapidly
	alter central nervous system excitability via novel nongenomic mechanisms.},

	Despite this prediction we identify a baseline state of the normal
	adult human brain in terms of the brain oxygen extraction fraction
	or OEF. The OEF is defined as the ratio of oxygen used by the brain
	to oxygen delivered by flowing blood and is remarkably uniform in
	the awake but resting state (e.g., lying quietly with eyes closed).
	Local deviations in the OEF represent the physiological basis of
	signals of changes in neuronal activity obtained with functional
	MRI during a wide variety of human behaviors. We used quantitative
	metabolic and circulatory measurements from positron-emission tomography
	to obtain the OEF regionally throughout the brain. Areas of activation
	were conspicuous by their absence. All significant deviations from
	the mean hemisphere OEF were increases, signifying deactivations,

  abstract = {Adolescence is associated with increases in pleasure-seeking behaviors,
	which, in turn, are shaped by the pubertal activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal
	axis. In animal models of naturally rewarding behaviors, such as
	sex, testicular androgens contribute to the development and expression
	of the behavior in males. To effect behavioral maturation, the brain
	undergoes significant remodeling during adolescence, and many of
	the changes are likewise sensitive to androgens, presumably acting
	through androgen receptors (AR). Given the delicate interaction of
	gonadal hormones and brain development, it is no surprise that disruption
	of hormone levels during this sensitive period significantly alters
	adolescent and adult behaviors. In male hamsters, exposure to testosterone
	during adolescence is required for normal expression of adult sexual
	behavior. Males deprived of androgens during puberty display sustained
	deficits in mating. Conversely, androgens alone are not sufficient
	to induce mating in prepubertal males, even though brain AR are present
	before puberty. In this context, wide-spread use of anabolic-androgenic
	steroids (AAS) during adolescence is a significant concern. AAS abuse
	has the potential to alter both the timing and the levels of androgens
	in adolescent males. In hamsters, adolescent AAS exposure increases
	aggression, and causes lasting changes in neurotransmitter systems.
	In addition, AAS are themselves reinforcing, as demonstrated by self-administration
	of testosterone and other AAS. However, recent evidence suggests
	that the reinforcing effects of androgens may not require classical
	AR. Therefore, further examination of interactions between androgens
	and rewarding behaviors in the adolescent brain is required for a
	better understanding of AAS abuse.},

	The original hypothesis posited that exposure to steroid hormones
	early in development masculinizes and defeminizes neural circuits,
	programming behavioral responses to hormones in adulthood. This hypothesis
	has inspired a multitude of experiments demonstrating that the perinatal
	period is a time of maximal sensitivity to gonadal steroid hormones.
	However, recent work from our laboratory and others demonstrates
	that steroid-dependent organization of behavior also occurs during
	adolescence, prompting a reassessment of the developmental time-frame
	within which organizational effects are possible. In addition, we
	present evidence that adolescence is part of a single protracted
	postnatal sensitive period for steroid-dependent organization of
	male mating behavior that begins perinatally and ends in late adolescence.
	These findings are consistent with the original formulation of the
	organizational/activational hypothesis, but extend our notions of
	what constitutes "early" development considerably. Finally, we present
	evidence that female behaviors also undergo steroid-dependent organization
	during adolescence, and that social experience modulates steroid-dependent
	adolescent brain and behavioral development. The implications for
	human adolescent development are also discussed, especially with

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Puberty, a complex biologic process involving sexual development,
	accelerated linear growth, and adrenal maturation, is initiated when
	gonadotropin-releasing hormone begins to be secreted by the hypothalamus.
	We conducted studies in humans and mice to identify the genetic factors
	that determine the onset of puberty. METHODS: We used complementary
	genetic approaches in humans and in mice. A consanguineous family
	with members who lacked pubertal development (idiopathic hypogonadotropic
	hypogonadism) was examined for mutations in a candidate gene, GPR54,
	which encodes a G protein-coupled receptor. Functional differences
	between wild-type and mutant GPR54 were examined in vitro. In parallel,
	a Gpr54-deficient mouse model was created and phenotyped. Responsiveness
	to exogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone was assessed in both
	the humans and the mice. RESULTS: Affected patients in the index
	pedigree were homozygous for an L148S mutation in GPR54, and an unrelated
	proband with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism was determined
	to have two separate mutations, R331X and X399R. The in vitro transfection
	of COS-7 cells with mutant constructs demonstrated a significantly
	decreased accumulation of inositol phosphate. The patient carrying
	the compound heterozygous mutations (R331X and X399R) had attenuated
	secretion of endogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone and a left-shifted
	dose-response curve for gonadotropin-releasing hormone as compared
	with six patients who had idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
	without GPR54 mutations. The Gpr54-deficient mice had isolated hypogonadotropic
	hypogonadism (small testes in male mice and a delay in vaginal opening
	and an absence of follicular maturation in female mice), but they
	showed responsiveness to both exogenous gonadotropins and gonadotropin-releasing

  abstract = {One of the basic functions of the cerebral cortex is the analysis

	strategies to cope with the combinatorial problem posed by the astronomical
	number of possible relations: (i) the analysis and representation
	of frequently occurring, behaviorally relevant relations by groups
	of cells with fixed but broadly tuned response properties; and (ii)
	the dynamic association of these cells into functionally coherent
	assemblies. Feedforward connections and reciprocal associative connections,
	respectively, are thought to underlie these two operations. The architectures
	of both types of connections are susceptible to experience-dependent
	modifications during development, but they become fixed in the adult.
	As development proceeds, feedforward connections also appear to lose
	much of their functional plasticity, whereas the synapses of the
	associative connections retain a high susceptibility to use-dependent
	modifications. The reduced plasticity of feedforward connections
	is probably responsible for the invariance of cognitive categories
	acquired early in development. The persistent adaptivity of reciprocal
	connections is a likely substrate for the ability to generate representations
	for new perceptual objects and motor patterns throughout life.},

	of copulatory behaviors in specific social contexts. These influences

	Reproductive maturity is therefore the product of developmentally

	give rise when implemented as dynamical systems. We selected among
	structurally varying graphs using as selective criteria a number
	of global information-theoretical measures that characterize functional
	connectivity. We selected graphs separately for increases in measures
	of entropy (capturing statistical independence of graph elements),
	integration (capturing their statistical dependence) and complexity
	(capturing the interplay between their functional segregation and
	integration). We found that dynamics with high complexity were supported
	by graphs whose units were organized into densely linked groups that
	were sparsely and reciprocally interconnected. Connection matrices
	based on actual neuroanatomical data describing areas and pathways
	of the macaque visual cortex and the cat cortex showed structural
	characteristics that coincided best with those of such complex graphs,
	revealing the presence of distinct but interconnected anatomical
	groupings of areas. Moreover, when implemented as dynamical systems,
	these cortical connection matrices generated functional connectivity
	with high complexity, characterized by the presence of highly coherent
	functional clusters. We also found that selection of graphs as they
	responded to input or produced output led to increases in the complexity
	of their dynamics. We hypothesize that adaptation to rich sensory
	environments and motor demands requires complex dynamics and that
	these dynamics are supported by neuroanatomical motifs that are characteristic

	In particular, we demonstrate that TE improved the detectability

	oscillatory multifiber activity impinges on postsynaptic neurons
	during membrane potential (V(m)) oscillations at 20 and 40 Hz. Synapses
	underwent long-term potentiation (LTP) when EPSPs coincided with
	the peaks of the V(m) oscillations but exhibited long-term depression
	(LTD) when EPSPs coincided with the troughs. The induction of LTP
	but not of LTD was NMDA receptor dependent, required additional activation
	of muscarinic receptors in older animals, and persisted in a kainate-driven
	increased conductance state. Thus, even when neuronal networks engage
	in high-frequency oscillations, synaptic plasticity remains exquisitely
	sensitive to the timing of discharges. This is an essential prerequisite

  abstract = {An increasingly large body of data exists which demonstrates that
	oscillations of frequency 12-80 Hz are a consequence of, or are inextricably
	linked to, the behaviour of inhibitory interneurons in the central
	nervous system. This frequency range covers the EEG bands beta 1
	(12-20 Hz), beta 2 (20-30 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz). The pharmacological
	profile of both spontaneous and sensory-evoked EEG potentials reveals
	a very strong influence on these rhythms by drugs which have direct
	effects on GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic transmission (general
	anaesthetics, sedative/hypnotics) or indirect effects on inhibitory
	neuronal function (opiates, ketamine). In addition, a number of experimental
	models of, in particular, gamma-frequency oscillations, have revealed
	both common denominators for oscillation generation and function,
	and subtle differences in network dynamics between the different
	frequency ranges. Powerful computer and mathematical modelling techniques
	based around both clinical and experimental observations have recently
	provided invaluable insight into the behaviour of large networks
	of interconnected neurons. In particular, the mechanistic profile
	of oscillations generated as an emergent property of such networks,
	and the mathematical derivation of this complex phenomenon have much
	to contribute to our understanding of how and why neurons oscillate.
	This review will provide the reader with a brief outline of the basic
	properties of inhibition-based oscillations in the CNS by combining
	research from laboratory models, large-scale neuronal network simulations,

	of their nodes, and of the topology and dynamics of their interactions.
	Exploratory tools for the identification of nodes are available,
	e.g. magnetoencephalography (MEG) in combination with beamformer
	source analysis. Competing network topologies and interaction models
	can be investigated using dynamic causal modelling. However, we lack
	a method for the exploratory investigation of network topologies
	to choose from the very large number of possible network graphs.
	Ideally, this method should not require a pre-specified model of
	the interaction. Transfer entropy--an information theoretic implementation
	of Wiener-type causality--is a method for the investigation of causal
	interactions (or information flow) that is independent of a pre-specified
	interaction model. We analysed MEG data from an auditory short-term
	memory experiment to assess whether the reconfiguration of networks
	implied in this task can be detected using transfer entropy. Transfer
	entropy analysis of MEG source-level signals detected changes in
	the network between the different task types. These changes prominently
	involved the left temporal pole and cerebellum--structures that have
	previously been implied in auditory short-term or working memory.
	Thus, the analysis of information flow with transfer entropy at the
	source-level may be used to derive hypotheses for further model-based
	testing.},

  abstract = {To understand the function of networks we have to identify the structure
	of their interactions, but also interaction timing, as compromised
	timing of interactions may disrupt network function. We demonstrate
	how both questions can be addressed using a modified estimator of
	transfer entropy. Transfer entropy is an implementation of Wiener's
	principle of observational causality based on information theory,
	and detects arbitrary linear and non-linear interactions. Using a
	modified estimator that uses delayed states of the driving system
	and independently optimized delayed states of the receiving system,
	we show that transfer entropy values peak if the delay of the state
	of the driving system equals the true interaction delay. In addition,
	we show how reconstructed delays from a bivariate transfer entropy
	analysis of a network can be used to label spurious interactions
	arising from cascade effects and apply this approach to local field
	potential (LFP) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data.},

	based on distances in reconstructed state spaces were introduced.
	These measures can, however, be biased by asymmetries in the dynamics'
	structure, noise color, or noise level, which are ubiquitous in experimental
	signals. Using theoretical reasoning and results from model systems
	we identify the various sources of bias and show that most of them
	can be eliminated by an appropriate normalization. We furthermore
	diminish the remaining biases by introducing a measure based on ranks
	of distances. This rank-based measure outperforms existing distance-based
	measures concerning both sensitivity and specificity for directional
	couplings. Therefore, our findings are relevant for a reliable detection
	of directional couplings from experimental signals.},
