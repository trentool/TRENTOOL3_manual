\textbf{field name} & \textbf{dimension} & \textbf{data type} & \textbf{description} \\ \midrule

TEpermvalues & [no. channel combinations x 5/6$^a$] & doubles & matrix with results of permutation testing for individual channel combinations. For each channel combination (i.e. each row), the matrix holds the following information:
\textbf{Column} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Values} \\ \midrule
&1 & p-value & $0$ to $1$ \\
\rowcolor{Gray}
&2 & stat. significance & $1$ significant at the provided alpha level, $0$ not significant \\
&3 & stat. significance after correction for multiple comparisons (CMC)& $1$ significant at the provided alpha level after CMC, $0$ not significant after CMC\\
\rowcolor{Gray}
&4 & mean difference & raw difference between empirical and surrogate data \\
&5 & volume conduction & indicates the presence ($1$) or absense ($0$) of volume conduction (is set to $NaN$ for ensemble method) \\
\rowcolor{Gray}
&6$^a$ & optimal $u$ & $u$ in msec, available only after  was ran on data\\

\multicolumn{3}{p{\textwidth}}{$^a$ A sixth column containing the optimal $u$ is only added if interaction delays are reconstructed for the data (using \texttt{InteractionDelayReconstruction\_analyze.m}, see section \ref{sec:interaction_delays})}\\
