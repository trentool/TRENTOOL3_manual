%% TRENTOOL 3.1 Release Notes - 14/04/2014 - www.trentool.de 
%
%
%	Main features:
%		- bugfix in TEcallGPUsearch.m
%		- group statistic
%		- fixes tau accidentally becoming 0 for small ACT values (overwrite with 1)
%		- minor fixes in TEprepare.m, TEsurrogatestats_binomstats.m



TEcallGPUsearch.m
	PW: added the substraction of eps from the radius for the range search (this was missing before)
	PW: added an option to turn off MI calculation (cfgTESS.MIcalc, saves computing time)
	PW: corrected the output in ncount.n_chunks
	
InteractionDelayReconstruction_calculate.m
	PW: function now checks whether group statistics are requested

InteractionDelayReconstruction_analyze.m
	PW: the field .TEmat is now kept in the output as this field is needed for group statistics, .TEmat is also returned as field in TEpermstats
	PW: the field .groupprepare is now kept in the output as this field is needed for group statistics

TEprepare.m
	PW: function now keeps data labels (needed for the group statistic)
	PW: included a check whether timeindex(2) >= timeindex(1)
	PW: maxact is now taken over the trials used for analysis only (before, this was a simple max() over ALL trials, also those excluded due to high ACT)

TEgraphanalysis.m
	PW: the user may now choose wheter corrected or uncorrected links are used for  graph correction (option .cmc in the cfg structure)
	PW: added .graphanalysis.triangles to the output, may be used for trivariate TE in a later step

Group statistics
	PW: adjusted all group functions to work with the updated workflow (InteractionDelayReconstruction etc.)

TRENTOOL2BrainNet.m
	PW: I wrote and added this function to the branch, allows to export TRENTOOL results to be used with BrainNet Viewer 

TEcmc.m
	PW: corrected an error in the function, that prevented the switch to BONF correction for small channel numbers

TEsetRandStream.m
	PW: added this function, sets the rand stream according to the user's MATLAB version -> this is now used in TEsurrogatestats_ensemble.m and TEperm.m

TEpvalue.m
	PW: if p is 0 (because the test statistic is actually the largest value in the surrogate distribution), it is replaced by 1/numpermutation

TEcalc.m
	PW: MI calculation is now optional (depending on the field cfgTESS.MIcalc)

TEcmc.m
	PW: bugfix - BONF correction in case of too little channel combinations was not effective before

example_script_ensemblemethod.m
	PW: included MIcalc as an option in cfgTESS

TEsurrogatestats_binomstats.m
	MW: bugfix, p-value was corrected by number of subjects instead of number of channel combinations

TEsurrogatestats_ensemble.m
	PW: function now accepts .MIcalc (optional MI calculation) and .GPUid (multiple GPU devices) as parameters
	PW: it is now checked, if tau is zero (after multiplying the opt. ragtau with the ACT), this may happen for small ACT and ragtau values, if tau is zero set to one

transferentropy.m
	PW: it is now checked, if tau is zero (after multiplying the opt. ragtau with the ACT), this may happen for small ACT and ragtau values, if tau is zero set to one
