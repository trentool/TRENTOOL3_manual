%% TRENTOOL 3.3 Release Notes - 18/12/2014 - www.trentool.de 
%
%
%	Main features:
%		- speed up for interaction delay reconstruction
%		- speed ups for group and single subject analysis
%		- bug fixes in group analysis functions
%		- TSTool functions are now integrated into TRENTOOL
%		- deprecated functions now issue a warning 
%

InteractionDelayReconstruction_calculate.m
	PW: TEprepare is now called only once for each data set, using the
	max. requested value for u (previously it was called for every u, which doesn't make a difference for the
	embedding parameter optimization)
	PW: The interaction delay is no reconstructed by only calculating the
	TE for all values for u and then testing only the value that maximizes
	TE for statistical significance

TEsurrogatestats.m, TEsurrogatestats_ensemble.m
	PW: minor changes to fit the new work flow

InteractionDelayReconstruction_analyze.m
	PW: new criterion for opt u selection to fit the new work flow

InteractionDelayReconstruction_plotting.m
	PW: changed to fit the new work flow

TEplot2D.m
	PW: new option that allows the plotting of the graph analysis output
	(plots flagged edges in red)
	PW: plotting the head contour is now optional

TEC_dsvalues.m, TEC_dsvalues_noSourceEmb.m
	PW: TSTool functions are now called for all search points at once,
	i.e. the function doesn't loop over neighbour searches per point -
	this saves a lot of computational time
	PW: bug fixes

TEgetACT.m
	PW: function that returns the ACT for the data, helps to determine
	parameters for embedding optimization

TEarch.m
	PW: Adds the appropriate subfolder of the tstool_functions folder
	(according to architecture and OS) - all functions calling TSTool
	functions now no longer need to cd into the TSTool folder
	(TEprepare.m, transferentropy.m, TEragwitz.m)

TEgroup_prepare.m
	PW: TEprepare is now called only once for each data set, using the
	max. requested u 
	PW: Parameter optimization is aborted if for any subject the max.
	requested dim (ragdim) is found to be optimal for embedding; the max.
	ragdim is then used for all data sets

TEprepare.m
	PW: Function now accepts scalar values for both ragtau and ragdim
	PW: The path to TSTool is no longer a necessary parameter

TEsurrogatestats_binomstats.m
	PW: added three additional outputs (occurrences, bino_cdf,
	occurr_thresh)
	PW: bug fix - cfg.alpha wasn't used

TRENTOOL2BrainNet.m	
	PW: bug fix in the edge coloring

TEsurrogatestats_ensemble.m
	PW: For debugging the neighbour counts can be written to disc

private/TEbacktracking.m
	PW: changed the output format for alternative paths

private/TEflagedges.m
	PW: simplified the code and added documentation

private/TEfindDelay.m
	PW: optimizes the interaction delay by calculating all TE values w/o
	doing surrogate testing

The following functions are considered deprecated:
	TEconditionstatssingle.m -> use TEgroup_prepare/TEgroup_stats instead
	TEgroup_calculate.m -> use TEgroup_prepare/TEgroup_stats instead
